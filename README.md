1.As given in the tutorial one there are two files server.c and client.c

2.For executing them they should be kept in different directories as same file downloading becomes an empty file.

3.First server.c should be executed and the file that should be transferred to client should be in same directory as server.c.

4.Then for server file ./a.out should be done then we execute client.c file and its ./a.out.

5.Input format is client> get <file1> <file2> <file3> for single file give only one input.

6.For disconnecting from server type exit as command line argument this disconnects and exits both server and client.â€¨
